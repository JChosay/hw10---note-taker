# hw10---note-taker

A very simple Express note-taking application, accepting and saving text input from users. 

When users enter a value into the notes area and click "save," the new note is entered into an array and a new one can then be entered and similarly stored. A tab to the left displays all notes in the Notes array, and clicking on each will recall the main tect to the screen.
